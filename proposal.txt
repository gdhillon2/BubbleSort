Final Project Proposal

Description:
My final project proposal is a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers and letters from lowest to highest.
It will take 1 string input from the user and sort all the characters they have input.
If there is punctuation in the string, the program will prompt the user to remove it before inputting again.
There will be 1 output string printed that has sorted the input string, putting numbers first then letters.
The program will also create an output.txt file that contains the sorted string.

Example input and output:
Input - 74bc3BC2a
Output - 2347BCabc

I will take the input string and break it up into two different strings.
One will contain the numbers, and the other will contain the strings.
I will separately sort these strings and then print them and write them to an output file together with the numbers first.

Functions:
I will have one function that goes through the string and checks for anything that isn't a letter or number.
If there isn't any, the code will continue but if there is the program will prompt the user to remove the punctuation and close the program.
Inputs - User-Inputted String
Output - Error Message/None

I will have another function that will take an input string and return a sorted version of it.
Inputs - String
Output - Sorted String

I will use the printf, fopen, fputs, and fclose functions from the C library.

Error conditions:
If the user inputs nothing or only 1 character, the program will prompt the user for a valid input.
If the user inputs a string containing punctuation/something containing not a letter or number, the program will ask the user to remove them and close.
